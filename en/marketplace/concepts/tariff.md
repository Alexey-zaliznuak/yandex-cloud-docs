# Service plan

A _service plan_ is the cost of using a software product for {{ marketplace-short-name }} users. A service plan must include:
* Product asking price, which is the amount the publisher would like to receive for his or her product, without VAT.
* Fee in the amount of 20% of the product asking price that is charged by {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* VAT.

If payment is at the end of a billing cycle, {{ yandex-cloud }} will deduct the fee and VAT from the rate if your legal entity does not pay VAT.

Different service plans are available for different types of products.

The table below demonstrates compatibility between different product types and service plans.
